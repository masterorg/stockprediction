# stockprediction
making neural Network for stock price prediction


Hole project is written in Python programming language. Beside basic libraries, I used: 
  pandas - for csv file manipulation 
  Theano - library for  basic mathematical operations inside neural network (its only for usage of Keras)
  Keras  - wrapper for Theano library (it does all calculations for me)
  
  
  The idea behinde this project is to use LSTM (Long - Short - )
